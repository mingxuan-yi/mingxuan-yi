I am a final-year PhD student in statistical machine learning at the University of Bristol, working with [Dr Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net/). Before that, I was a machine learning engineer working on natural language processing at Samsung Research.

In general, my research interests lie in a broad range of (deep) probabilistic machine learning, with applications from generative modeling to language models. A key focus of my current research is the development of efficient and scalable algorithms for Bayesian learning, Monte Carlo methods, and score-based generative models. Some of my areas of expertise:
- Bayesian machine learning
- Monte Carlo sampling
- Density ratio estimation
- Optimal transport and gradient flows
